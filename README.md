# python-loops_practice.py

## This repository contains Python practice files for learning loops, nested loops, and understanding time complexity. It includes various examples of:

- `for` loops  
- Nested `for` loops  
- `while` loops  
- Different time complexities (O(n), O(n^2), O(n^3), O(log n), etc.)  

This project is aimed at beginners who want to strengthen their programming logic and problem-solving skills.
